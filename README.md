# Shunting-yard Calculator

> The Shunting-yard Calculator is written in C++ by [@TylerJenningsW](https://github.com/TylerJenningsW) and [@MichaelLillis](https://github.com/MichaelLillis) using the Shaunting-yard algorithm and [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) as the primary interface library. 

>*NOTE:* This project is meant to be a learning experience, as both authors had limited knowledge of C++ and the wxWidgets library going into the project.
